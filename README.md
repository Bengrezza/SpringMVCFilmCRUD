## Overview
Hello! And welcome to our website!

This website has a couple of different purposes, all relating to a databse of films and their related properties!

You will be able to query a database of films and even update the database with your own films!

To get started, click the 'Lookup Film' radio button, this will present you with two different ways to look up a film...
1. By the ID
2. By a keyword or description

After you get done querying films, the website has another function to add a film object to the database.

To do this, from our home directory, Hit the 'Add Film' radio button

On this page, you will be able to fill in all the fields required to add in a film.
